# Code Refactor Challenge for Horiseon Social Solution Services by Gina Bauza

## Description

 For this challenge, I was tasked with cleaning (debugging) HTML and CSS files for front-end website work for the fictional marketing agency, Horiseon.


## Description

These are the following changes to enhance website accessibility:

Fixed the dreaded div soup chaos with appropriate headings.
Semantic HTML elements replace non-semantic elements.
HTML structure and CSS code reordered to be in alignment with each other and functional.
Descriptive alt attributes added to image tags.
Added Welcome Title.
Corrected issue with Right Float.
CSS code consolidated - Services and Benefits are now grouped together and not individualized. Code redundancies removed.
Centered footer section on website.

## Usage

All materials should be present within repository. 

## Credits

All contributions are from me, github.com/songbirdcode.

All can be adjusted as required as I continue to learn and grow. As we face more group projects, I will add more here. 

I used sources from reading developer.mozilla.org, learn.shayhowe.com, w3schools.com, along with materials presented within our bootcamp.
